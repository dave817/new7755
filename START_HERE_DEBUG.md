## 🛑 STEP 1: Kill and Restart Server (CRITICAL!)

The most common issue is that the server is running with old code.

### Method A: Use the script (Easiest)
```
Double-click: kill_and_restart.bat
```

### Method B: Manual
```cmd
# 1. Kill all Python
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# 2. Wait 5 seconds
timeout /t 5

# 3. Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\7755_clone\Desktop\7755

# 4. Start server
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### ✅ What to look for when server starts:

**YOU MUST SEE THESE MESSAGES:**

```
📁 PictureManager initialized:
   Base path: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\7755_clone\Desktop\7755\pictures
   Female path exists: True
   Male path exists: True
✅ Mounted pictures directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\7755_clone\Desktop\7755\pictures
Database initialized successfully
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**❌ If you DON'T see the PictureManager messages:**
- Old code is running
- Try killing Python again
- Restart your computer if necessary

---

## 🧪 STEP 2: Test the API

While server is running, open a NEW command prompt:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\7755_clone\Desktop\7755
python debug_picture.py
```

### ✅ Expected output:

```
✅ 'character_picture' field EXISTS!
📸 Picture URL: /pictures/female/xxx.png
✅ Picture is ACCESSIBLE!
✅ API TEST PASSED!
```

### ❌ If test FAILS:
- API is not returning picture
- Server didn't restart properly
- Go back to Step 1

### ✅ If test PASSES:
- API is working correctly
- Problem is in the frontend
- Continue to Step 3

---

## 🌐 STEP 3: Clear Browser and Test

### A. Close ALL browser windows

### B. Open browser in Incognito/Private mode
- **Chrome/Edge:** Ctrl+Shift+N
- **Firefox:** Ctrl+Shift+P

### C. Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/ui2
```

### D. Open Developer Tools
Press: **F12**

### E. Go to Console tab
You should see a clean console with no errors

---

## 🎯 STEP 4: Create Character and Watch Console

### Fill in the form:
- Your Name: `測試`
- Your Gender: `男`
- Preference: `女` ← IMPORTANT (to get female picture)
- Talking Style: `溫柔體貼`
- Add some personality traits
- Click through to generate

### 👀 Watch the Console (F12 → Console tab)

**YOU SHOULD SEE THESE DEBUG MESSAGES:**

```
🔍 API Response: {success: true, user_id: ..., character_picture: "/pictures/female/xxx.png", ...}
🖼️ Character Picture: /pictures/female/xxx.png
✅ Calling displayCharacter with picture: /pictures/female/xxx.png
📋 displayCharacter called
   Character: 小雨
   Picture URL: /pictures/female/xxx.png
🖼️ Picture HTML: Generated
💬 Calling displayMessage with picture: /pictures/female/xxx.png
💬 displayMessage called
   Sender: 小雨
   Type: character
   Picture: /pictures/female/xxx.png
🖼️ Chat Picture HTML: Generated
✅ Message displayed in chat
```

## 📊 INTERPRETING THE RESULTS

### ✅ SCENARIO 1: You see all the debug messages AND the picture
**Result:** SUCCESS! Everything is working!

### ❌ SCENARIO 2: You see `Character Picture: null`
**Problem:** API is not returning the picture
**Solution:**
- Server didn't restart properly
- Go back to Step 1
- Make sure you see PictureManager initialization

### ❌ SCENARIO 3: You see picture URL but image doesn't display
**Problem:** Picture file or path issue

**Check in Console:**
1. Go to Network tab (F12 → Network)
2. Filter by "Img"
3. Look for request to `/pictures/female/xxx.png`
4. Check status:
   - **200 OK** = File loads correctly (maybe CSS issue)
   - **404 Not Found** = File doesn't exist
   - **No request** = JavaScript isn't creating img element

### ❌ SCENARIO 4: No debug messages at all
**Problem:** Old JavaScript is running (browser cache)

**Solution:**
```
1. Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Clear cache)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Select "Cookies and site data"
4. Click Clear
5. Close ALL browser windows
6. Reopen in incognito: Ctrl+Shift+N
7. Try again
```

## 🔧 COMMON SOLUTIONS

```cmd
# Kill EVERYTHING
taskkill /F /IM python.exe
taskkill /F /IM pythonw.exe

# Restart computer
# Then start server fresh
```

### Solution 2: Browser cache won't clear

```

### Solution 3: Pictures folder issue
```cmd
